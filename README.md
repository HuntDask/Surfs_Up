# Surfs_Up

## Overview of the analysis 
For this proejct, we are asked to examine the different temperature trends for an investor before he opens a surf shop in Hawaii. To do this, we are tasked to use SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask to build SQL database structures and querying methods in order to further examine and study our data. We coded in Jupyter notebook using our SQLite files in order to idetify specific stastical anaylsis's that we were asked to find. In our Delieverabels, we looked at the months of June and Decemeber to identify trends in the weather for our potential investment in the surf shop.

## Results
